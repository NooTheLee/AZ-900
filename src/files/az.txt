Question #2 Topic 1
Your company has datacenters in Los Angeles and New York. The company has a Microsoft Azure subscription.
You are configuring the two datacenters as geo-clustered sites for site resiliency.
You need to recommend an Azure storage redundancy option.
You have the following data storage requirements:
✑ Data must be stored on multiple nodes.
✑ Data must be stored on nodes in separate geographic locations.
✑ Data can be read from the secondary location as well as from the primary location
Which of the following Azure stored redundancy options should you recommend?
A. Geo-redundant storage
B. Read-only geo-redundant storage
C. Zone-redundant storage
D. Locally redundant storage
Correct Answer: B
RA-GRS allows you to have higher read availability for your storage account by providing ג€read only ג€ access to the data replicated to the
secondary location. Once you enable this feature, the secondary location may be used to achieve higher availability in the event the data is not
available in the primary region. This is an
ג€opt-in ג€ feature which requires the storage account be geo-replicated.

Correct Answer:
Box 1: Yes -
Traditionally, IT expenses have been considered a Capital Expenditure (CapEx). Today, with the move to the cloud and the pay-as-you-go model,
organizations have the ability to stretch their budgets and are shifting their IT CapEx costs to Operating Expenditures (OpEx) instead. This
flexibility, in accounting terms, is now an option due to the ג€as a Service ג€ model of purchasing software, cloud storage and other IT related
resources.
Box 2: No -
Two virtual machines using the same size could have different disk configurations. Therefore, the monthly costs could be different.
Box 3: Yes -
When an Azure virtual machine is stopped, you don't pay for the virtual machine. However, you do still pay for the storage costs associated to
the virtual machine.
The most common storage costs are for the disks attached to the virtual machines. There are also other storage costs associated with a virtual
machine such as storage for diagnostic data and virtual machine backups.

To complete the sentence, select the appropriate option in the answer area.
Hot Area:
Correct Answer:
When you are implementing a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, you are responsible for configuring the SaaS solution. Everything else is
managed by the cloud provider.
SaaS requires the least amount of management. The cloud provider is responsible for managing everything, and the end user just uses the
software.
Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. Common examples are email, calendaring
and office tools
(such as Microsoft Office 365).
SaaS provides a complete software solution which you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. You rent the use of an
app for your organization and your users connect to it over the Internet, usually with a web browser. All of the underlying infrastructure,
middleware, app software and app data are located in the service provider's data center. The service provider manages the hardware and
software and with the appropriate service agreement, will ensure the availability and the security of the app and your data as well.

You have an on-premises network that contains several servers.
You plan to migrate all the servers to Azure.
You need to recommend a solution to ensure that some of the servers are available if a single Azure data center goes offline for an extended
period.
What should you include in the recommendation?
A. fault tolerance
B. elasticity
C. scalability
D. low latency
Correct Answer: A
Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to continue to function in the event of a failure of some of its components.
In this question, you could have servers that are replicated across datacenters.
Availability zones expand the level of control you have to maintain the availability of the applications and data on your VMs. Availability Zones
are unique physical locations within an Azure region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power,
cooling, and networking. To ensure resiliency, there are a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions. The physical separation of
Availability Zones within a region protects applications and data from datacenter failures.
With Availability Zones, Azure offers industry best 99.99% VM uptime SLA. By architecting your solutions to use replicated VMs in zones, you
can protect your applications and data from the loss of a datacenter. If one zone is compromised, then replicated apps and data are instantly
available in another zone.

Hot Area:
Correct Answer:
A private cloud is hosted in your datacenter. Therefore, you cannot close your datacenter if you are using a private cloud.
A public cloud is hosted externally, for example, in Microsoft Azure. An organization that hosts its infrastructure in a public cloud can close its
data center.
Public cloud is the most common deployment model. In this case, you have no local hardware to manage or keep up-to-date ג€" everything runs
on your cloud provider's hardware.
Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud provider.
In a private cloud, you create a cloud environment in your own datacenter and provide self-service access to compute resources to users in your
organization.
This offers a simulation of a public cloud to your users, but you remain completely responsible for the purchase and maintenance of the
hardware and software services you provide.

What are two characteristics of the public cloud? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
A. dedicated hardware
B. unsecured connections
C. limited storage
D. metered pricing
E. self-service management
Correct Answer: DE
With the public cloud, you get pay-as-you-go pricing ג€" you pay only for what you use, no CapEx costs.
With the public cloud, you have self-service management. You are responsible for the deployment and configuration of the cloud resources such
as virtual machines or web sites. The underlying hardware that hosts the cloud resources is managed by the cloud provider.
Incorrect Answers:
A: You don't have dedicated hardware. The underlying hardware is shared so you could have multiple customers using cloud resources hosted
on the same physical hardware.
B: Connections to the public cloud are secure.
C: Storage is not limited. You can have as much storage as you like.

Your company hosts an accounting application named App1 that is used by all the customers of the company.
App1 has low usage during the first three weeks of each month and very high usage during the last week of each month.
Which benefit of Azure Cloud Services supports cost management for this type of usage pattern?
A. high availability
B. high latency
C. elasticity
D. load balancing
Correct Answer: C
Elasticity in this case is the ability to provide additional compute resource when needed and reduce the compute resource when not needed to
reduce costs.
Autoscaling is an example of elasticity.
Elastic computing is the ability to quickly expand or decrease computer processing, memory and storage resources to meet changing demands
without worrying about capacity planning and engineering for peak usage. Typically controlled by system monitoring tools, elastic computing
matches the amount of resources allocated to the amount of resources actually needed without disrupting operations. With cloud elasticity, a
company avoids paying for unused capacity or idle resources and doesn't have to worry about investing in the purchase or maintenance of
additional resources and equipment.

Capital expenditure is the spending of money up-front for infrastructure such as new servers.
With a hybrid cloud, you can continue to use the on-premises servers while adding new servers in the public cloud (Azure for example). Adding
new servers in
Azure minimizes the capital expenditure costs as you are not paying for new servers as you would if you deployed new server on-premises.
Incorrect Answers:
A: A complete migration of 100 servers to the public cloud would involve a lot of operational expenditure (the cost of migrating all the servers).
B: An additional data center would involve a lot of capital expenditure (the cost of the new infrastructure).
C: A private cloud is hosted on on-premises servers to this would involve a lot of capital expenditure (the cost of the new infrastructure to host
the private cloud).

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
Hot Area:
Correct Answer:
Box 1: No -
It is not true that a company must always migrate from a private cloud model to implement a hybrid cloud. You could start with a public cloud
and then combine that with an on-premise infrastructure to implement a hybrid cloud.
Box 2: Yes -
A company can extend the capacity of its internal network by using the public cloud. This is very common. When you need more capacity, rather
than pay out for new on-premises infrastructure, you can configure a cloud environment and connect your on-premises network to the cloud
environment by using a VPN.
Box 3: No -
It is not true that only guest users can access cloud resources. You can give anyone with an account in Azure Active Directory access to the
cloud resources.
There are many authentication scenarios but a common one is to replicate your on-premises Active Directory accounts to Azure Active Directory
and provide access to the Azure Active Directory accounts. Another commonly used authentication method is 'Federation' where authentication
for access to cloud resources is passed to another authentication provider such as an on-premises Active Directory.

Question #49 Topic 1
You plan to migrate several servers from an on-premises network to Azure.
What is an advantage of using a public cloud service for the servers over an on-premises network?
A. The public cloud is owned by the public, NOT a private corporation
B. The public cloud is a crowd-sourcing solution that provides corporations with the ability to enhance the cloud
C. All public cloud resources can be freely accessed by every member of the public
D. The public cloud is a shared entity whereby multiple corporations each use a portion of the resources in the cloud
Correct Answer: D
The public cloud is a shared entity whereby multiple corporations each use a portion of the resources in the cloud. The hardware resources
(servers, infrastructure etc.) are managed by the cloud provider. Multiple companies create resources such as virtual machines and virtual
networks on the hardware resources.
Incorrect Answers:
A: The public cloud is not owned by the public. In the case of Microsoft Azure, the cloud is owned by Microsoft.
B: The public cloud is a not crowd-sourcing solution. In the case of Microsoft Azure, the cloud is owned by Microsoft.
C: It is not true that public cloud resources can be freely accessed by every member of the public. You pay for a cloud subscription and create
accounts for your users to access your cloud resources. No one can access your cloud resources until you create user accounts and provide
the appropriate access permissions.

You have 1,000 virtual machines hosted on the Hyper-V hosts in a data center.
You plan to migrate all the virtual machines to an Azure pay-as-you-go subscription.
You need to identify which expenditure model to use for the planned Azure solution.
Which expenditure model should you identify?
A. operational
B. elastic
C. capital
D. scalable
Correct Answer: A
One of the major changes that you will face when you move from on-premises cloud to the public cloud is the switch from capital expenditure
(buying hardware) to operating expenditure (paying for service as you use it). This switch also requires more careful management of your costs.
The benefit of the cloud is that you can fundamentally and positively affect the cost of a service you use by merely shutting down or resizing it
when it's not needed.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
Hot Area:
Correct Answer:
Box 1: No -
You would need to setup the VNET connections, for example with peering.
Note: You can connect virtual networks to each other with virtual network peering. These virtual networks can be in the same region or different
regions (also known as Global VNet peering). Once virtual networks are peered, resources in both virtual networks can communicate with each
other.
Box 2: Yes -
All Azure resource types have a scope that defines the level that resource names must be unique. A resource must have a unique name within
its scope.
For example, a virtual network has a resource group scope, which means that there can be only one network named vnet-prod-westus-001 in a
given resource group.
Box 3: Yes -
As you build your network in Azure, it is important to keep in mind the following universal design principles:
Ensure non-overlapping address spaces. Make sure your VNet address space (CIDR block) does not overlap with your organization's other
network ranges.

What are two benefits of cloud computing? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
A. enables the rapid provisioning of resources
B. has increased administrative complexity
C. has the same configuration options as on-premises
D. shifts capital expenditures (CAPEX) to operating expenditures (OPEX)
Correct Answer: AD
Azure allows you to build, deploy, and manage apps more quickly and easily without having to buy and/or maintain the underlying infrastructure.
Azure provides flexibility between CapEx and OpEx
Capital expenditures generate benefits over a long period. These expenditures are generally nonrecurring and result in the acquisition of
permanent assets.
Building an application could qualify as a capital expenditure. Example, Azure Reserved Instances (Azure RI) help Azure's most active
customers save on long- term VM usage reserving VMs in advance at a discounted price by committing to a one or three-year benefits.
Operating expenditures are ongoing costs of doing business. Consuming cloud services in a pay-as-you-go model could qualify as an operating
expenditure.
Example, you pay for a service or product as you use it i.e. pay-as-you-go pricing.

You need to identify the type of failure for which an Azure Availability Zone can be used to protect access to Azure services.
What should you identify?
A. a physical server failure
B. an Azure region failure
C. a storage failure
D. an Azure data center failure
Correct Answer: D
Availability zones expand the level of control you have to maintain the availability of the applications and data on your VMs. An Availability Zone
is a physically separate zone, within an Azure region. There are three Availability Zones per supported Azure region.
Each Availability Zone has a distinct power source, network, and cooling. By architecting your solutions to use replicated VMs in zones, you can
protect your apps and data from the loss of a datacenter. If one zone is compromised, then replicated apps and data are instantly available in
another zone.

HOTSPOT -
You plan to extend your company's network to Azure.
The network contains a VPN appliance that uses an IP address of 131.107.200.1.
You need to create an Azure resource that defines the VPN appliance in Azure.
Which Azure resource should you create? To answer, select the appropriate resource in the answer area.
Hot Area:
Correct Answer:
A Local Network Gateway is an object in Azure that represents your on-premise VPN device. A Virtual Network Gateway is the VPN object at the
Azure end of the
VPN. A 'connection' is what connects the Local Network Gateway and the Virtual Network Gateway to bring up the VPN.
The local network gateway typically refers to your on-premises location. You give the site a name by which Azure can refer to it, then specify the
IP address of the on-premises VPN device to which you will create a connection. You also specify the IP address prefixes that will be routed
through the VPN gateway to the VPN device. The address prefixes you specify are the prefixes located on your on-premises network. If your onpremises
network changes or you need to change the public IP address for the VPN device, you can easily update the values later.

Question #98 Topic 1

You plan to deploy several Azure virtual machines.
You need to ensure that the services running on the virtual machines are available if a single data center fails.
Solution: You deploy the virtual machines to two or more resource groups.
Does this meet the goal?
A. Yes
B. No
Correct Answer: B
A resource group is a logical container for Azure resources. When you create a resource group, you specify which location to create the
resource group in.
However, when you create a virtual machine and place it in the resource group, the virtual machine can still be in a different location (different
datacenter).
Therefore, creating multiple resource groups, even if they are in separate datacenters does not ensure that the services running on the virtual
machines are available if a single data center fails.

Question #99 Topic 1

You plan to deploy several Azure virtual machines.
You need to ensure that the services running on the virtual machines are available if a single data center fails.
Solution: You deploy the virtual machines to a scale set.
Does this meet the goal?
A. Yes
B. No
Correct Answer: B
This answer does not specify that the scale set will be configured across multiple data centers so this solution does not meet the goal.
Azure virtual machine scale sets let you create and manage a group of load balanced VMs. The number of VM instances can automatically
increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule. Scale sets provide high availability to your applications, and allow you to
centrally manage, configure, and update many VMs.
Virtual machines in a scale set can be deployed across multiple update domains and fault domains to maximize availability and resilience to
outages due to data center outages, and planned or unplanned maintenance events.

Resource groups provide organizations with the ability to manage the compliance of Azure resources across multiple subscriptions.
Instructions: Review the underlined text. If it makes the statement correct, select `No change is needed`. If the statement is incorrect, select the
answer choice that makes the statement correct.
A. No change is needed
B. Management groups
C. Azure policies
D. Azure App Service plans
Correct Answer: C
Azure policies can be used to define requirements for resource properties during deployment and for already existing resources. Azure Policy
controls properties such as the types or locations of resources.
Azure Policy is a service in Azure that you use to create, assign, and manage policies. These policies enforce different rules and effects over
your resources, so those resources stay compliant with your corporate standards and service level agreements. Azure Policy meets this need by
evaluating your resources for non- compliance with assigned policies. All data stored by Azure Policy is encrypted at rest.
For example, you can have a policy to allow only a certain SKU size of virtual machines in your environment. Once this policy is implemented,
new and existing resources are evaluated for compliance. With the right type of policy, existing resources can be brought into compliance.

The company has several departments. All the Azure resources used by each department will be managed by a department administrator.
What are two possible techniques to segment Azure for the departments? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
A. multiple subscriptions
B. multiple Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) directories
C. multiple regions
D. multiple resource groups
Correct Answer: AD
An Azure subscription is a container for Azure resources. It is also a boundary for permissions to resources and for billing. You are charged
monthly for all resources in a subscription. A single Azure tenant (Azure Active Directory) can contain multiple Azure subscriptions.
A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group can include all the resources for the
solution, or only those resources that you want to manage as a group.
To enable each department administrator to manage the Azure resources used by that department, you will need to create a separate
subscription per department. You can then assign each department administrator as an administrator for the subscription to enable them to
manage all resources in that subscription.

A. an Azure SQL database
B. a virtual machine data disk
C. a File service in a storage account
D. a Blob service in a storage account
Correct Answer: C
Azure Files is Microsoft's easy-to-use cloud file system. Azure file shares can be seamlessly used in Windows and Windows Server.
To use an Azure file share with Windows, you must either mount it, which means assigning it a drive letter or mount point path, or access it via
its UNC path.
Unlike other SMB shares you may have interacted with, such as those hosted on a Windows Server, Linux Samba server, or NAS device, Azure
file shares do not currently support Kerberos authentication with your Active Directory (AD) or Azure Active Directory (AAD) identity, although
this is a feature we are working on.
Instead, you must access your Azure file share with the storage account key for the storage account containing your Azure file share. A storage
account key is an administrator key for a storage account, including administrator permissions to all files and folders within the file share you're
accessing, and for all file shares and other storage resources (blobs, queues, tables, etc) contained within your storage account.

Azure storage offers different access tiers: hot, cool and archive.
The archive access tier has the lowest storage cost. But it has higher data retrieval costs compared to the hot and cool tiers. Data in the archive
tier can take several hours to retrieve.
While a blob is in archive storage, the blob data is offline and can't be read, overwritten, or modified. To read or download a blob in archive, you
must first rehydrate it to an online tier.
Example usage scenarios for the archive access tier include:

Question #122 Topic 1

You plan to deploy several Azure virtual machines.
You need to ensure that the services running on the virtual machines are available if a single data center fails.
Solution: You deploy the virtual machines to two or more scale sets.
Does this meet the goal?
A. Yes
B. No
Correct Answer: B
This answer does not specify that the scale set will be configured across multiple data centers so this solution does not meet the goal.
Azure virtual machine scale sets let you create and manage a group of load balanced VMs. The number of VM instances can automatically
increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule. Scale sets provide high availability to your applications, and allow you to
centrally manage, configure, and update many VMs.
Virtual machines in a scale set can be deployed across multiple update domains and fault domains to maximize availability and resilience to
outages due to data center outages, and planned or unplanned maintenance events.

Correct Answer:
Availability zones expand the level of control you have to maintain the availability of the applications and data on your VMs. Availability Zones
are unique physical locations within an Azure region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power,
cooling, and networking. To ensure resiliency, there are a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions. The physical separation of
Availability Zones within a region protects applications and data from datacenter failures.
With Availability Zones, Azure offers industry best 99.99% VM uptime SLA. By architecting your solutions to use replicated VMs in zones, you
can protect your applications and data from the loss of a datacenter. If one zone is compromised, then replicated apps and data are instantly
available in another zone.

Box 1: No -
A resource can interact with resources in other resource groups.
Box 2: Yes -
Deleting the resource group will remove the resource group as well as all the resources in that resource group. This can be useful for the
management of resources. For example, a virtual machine has several components (the VM itself, virtual disks, network adapter etc.). By
placing the VM in its own resource group, you can delete the VM along with all its associated components by deleting the resource group.
Another example is when creating a test environment. You could place the entire test environment (Network components, virtual machines etc.)
in one resource group. You can then delete the entire test environment by deleting the resource group.
Box 3: Yes -
Resources from multiple different regions can be placed in a resource group. The resource group only contains metadata about the resources it
contains.

Question #174 Topic 1
You plan to deploy a website to Azure. The website will be accessed by users worldwide and will host large video files.
You need to recommend which Azure feature must be used to provide the best video playback experience.
What should you recommend?
A. an application gateway
B. an Azure ExpressRoute circuit
C. a content delivery network (CDN)
D. an Azure Traffic Manager profile
Correct Answer: C
The question states that users are located worldwide and will be downloading large video files. The video playback experience would be
improved if they can download the video from servers in the same region as the users. We can achieve this by using a content deliver network.
A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. CDNs store cached
content on edge servers in point-of-presence (POP) locations that are close to end users, to minimize latency.
Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) offers developers a global solution for rapidly delivering high-bandwidth content to users by caching
their content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world. Azure CDN can also accelerate dynamic content, which cannot be cached,
by leveraging various network optimizations using CDN POPs. For example, route optimization to bypass Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
The benefits of using Azure CDN to deliver web site assets include:
✑ Better performance and improved user experience for end users, especially when using applications in which multiple round-trips are
required to load content.
✑ Large scaling to better handle instantaneous high loads, such as the start of a product launch event.
✑ Distribution of user requests and serving of content directly from edge servers so that less traffic is sent to the origin server.

For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
Hot Area:
Correct Answer:
Box 1: No -
Azure firewall does not encrypt network traffic. It is used to block or allow traffic based on source/destination IP address, source/destination
ports and protocol.
Box 2: No -
A network security group does not encrypt network traffic. It works in a similar way to a firewall in that it is used to block or allow traffic based
on source/ destination IP address, source/destination ports and protocol.
Box 3: No -
The question is rather vague as it would depend on the configuration of the host on the Internet. Windows Server does come with a VPN client
and it also supports other encryption methods such IPSec encryption or SSL/TLS so it could encrypt the traffic if the Internet host was
configured to require or accept the encryption.
However, the VM could not encrypt the traffic to an Internet host that is not configured to require the encryption.

What should you include in the recommendation?
A. Azure Key Vault
B. Azure Information Protection
C. Azure Security Center
D. Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Correct Answer: A
Azure Key Vault is a secure store for storage various types of sensitive information. In this question, we would store the administrative
credentials in the Key Vault.
With this solution, there is no need to store the administrative credentials as plain text in the deployment scripts.
All information stored in the Key Vault is encrypted.
Azure Key Vault can be used to Securely store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets.
Secrets and keys are safeguarded by Azure, using industry-standard algorithms, key lengths, and hardware security modules (HSMs). The HSMs
used are
Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 Level 2 validated.
Access to a key vault requires proper authentication and authorization before a caller (user or application) can get access. Authentication
establishes the identity of the caller, while authorization determines the operations that they are allowed to perform.

Azure Information Protection is used to automatically add a watermark to Microsoft Word documents that contain credit card information.
You use Azure Information Protection labels to apply classification to documents and emails. When you do this, the classification is identifiable
regardless of where the data is stored or with whom it's shared. The labels can include visual markings such as a header, footer, or watermark.
Labels can be applied automatically by administrators who define rules and conditions, manually by users, or a combination where users are
given recommendations. In this question, we would configure a label to be automatically applied to Microsoft Word documents that contain
credit card information. The label would then add the watermark to the documents.

You need to ensure that when Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) users connect to Azure AD from the Internet by using an anonymous IP address,
the users are prompted automatically to change their password.
Which Azure service should you use?
A. Azure AD Connect Health
B. Azure AD Privileged Identity Management
C. Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)
D. Azure AD Identity Protection
Correct Answer: D
Azure AD Identity Protection includes two risk policies: sign-in risk policy and user risk policy. A sign-in risk represents the probability that a
given authentication request isn't authorized by the identity owner.
There are several types of risk detection. One of them is Anonymous IP Address. This risk detection type indicates sign-ins from an anonymous
IP address (for example, Tor browser or anonymous VPN). These IP addresses are typically used by actors who want to hide their login
telemetry (IP address, location, device, etc.) for potentially malicious intent.
You can configure the sign-in risk policy to require that users change their password.

Your network contains an Active Directory forest. The forest contains 5,000 user accounts.
Your company plans to migrate all network resources to Azure and to decommission the on-premises data center.
You need to recommend a solution to minimize the impact on users after the planned migration.
What should you recommend?
A. Implement Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
B. Sync all the Active Directory user accounts to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
C. Instruct all users to change their password
D. Create a guest user account in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for each user
Correct Answer: B
To migrate to Azure and decommission the on-premises data center, you would need to create the 5,000 user accounts in Azure Active
Directory. The easy way to do this is to sync all the Active Directory user accounts to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You can even sync their
passwords to further minimize the impact on users.
The tool you would use to sync the accounts is Azure AD Connect. The Azure Active Directory Connect synchronization services (Azure AD
Connect sync) is a main component of Azure AD Connect. It takes care of all the operations that are related to synchronize identity data
between your on-premises environment and
Azure AD.

Box 1: Yes -
You can send Azure AD activity logs to Azure Monitor logs to enable rich visualizations, monitoring and alerting on the connected data.
All data collected by Azure Monitor fits into one of two fundamental types, metrics and logs (including Azure AD activity logs). Activity logs
record when resources are created or modified. Metrics tell you how the resource is performing and the resources that it's consuming.
Box 2: Yes -
Azure Monitor can consolidate log entries from multiple Azure resources, subscriptions, and tenants into one location for analysis together.
Box 3: Yes -
You can create alerts in Azure Monitor.
Alerts in Azure Monitor proactively notify you of critical conditions and potentially attempt to take corrective action. Alert rules based on
metrics provide near real time alerting based on numeric values, while rules based on logs allow for complex logic across data from multiple

You create a resource group named RG1 in Azure Resource Manager.
You need to prevent the accidental deletion of the resources in RG1.
Which setting should you use? To answer, select the appropriate setting in the answer area.
Hot Area:
Correct Answer:
You can configure a lock on a resource group to prevent the accidental deletion.
As an administrator, you may need to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource to prevent other users in your organization from
accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources. You can set the lock level to CanNotDelete or ReadOnly. In the portal, the locks are called
Delete and Read-only respectively.
✑ CanNotDelete means authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they can't delete the resource.
✑ ReadOnly means authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resource. Applying this lock is similar to restricting
all authorized users to the permissions granted by the Reader role.

You have a resource group named RG1.
You need to prevent the creation of virtual machines in RG1. The solution must ensure that other objects can be created in RG1.
What should you use?
A. a lock
B. an Azure role
C. a tag
D. an Azure policy
Correct Answer: D
Azure policies can be used to define requirements for resource properties during deployment and for already existing resources. Azure Policy
controls properties such as the types or locations of resources.
Azure Policy is a service in Azure that you use to create, assign, and manage policies. These policies enforce different rules and effects over
your resources, so those resources stay compliant with your corporate standards and service level agreements.
In this question, we would create an Azure policy assigned to the resource group that denies the creation of virtual machines in the resource
group.
You could place a read-only lock on the resource group. However, that would prevent the creation of any resources in the resource group, not
virtual machines only. Therefore, an Azure Policy is a better solution.

What can Azure Information Protection encrypt?
A. network traffic
B. documents and email messages
C. an Azure Storage account

Correct Answer: B
Azure Information Protection can encrypt documents and emails.
Azure Information Protection is a cloud-based solution that helps an organization to classify and optionally, protect its documents and emails
by applying labels.
Labels can be applied automatically by administrators who define rules and conditions, manually by users, or a combination where users are
given recommendations.
The protection technology uses Azure Rights Management (often abbreviated to Azure RMS). This technology is integrated with other Microsoft
cloud services and applications, such as Office 365 and Azure Active Directory.
This protection technology uses encryption, identity, and authorization policies. Similarly to the labels that are applied, protection that is applied
by using Rights
Management stays with the documents and emails, independently of the location ג€" inside or outside your organization, networks, file servers,
and applications.

Box 1: No -
Authorization to access Azure resources can be provided by other identity providers by using federation. A commonly used example of this is to
federate your on- premises Active Directory environment with Azure AD and use this federation for authentication and authorization.
Box 2: Yes -
As described above, third-party cloud services and on-premises Active Directory can be used to access Azure resources. This is known as
'federation'.
Federation is a collection of domains that have established trust. The level of trust may vary, but typically includes authentication and almost
always includes authorization. A typical federation might include a number of organizations that have established trust for shared access to a
set of resources.
Box 3: Yes -
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a centralized identity provider in the cloud. This is the primary built-in authentication and authorization

Single sign-on is an authentication method that allows users to sign in using one set of credentials to login across applications. Single sign-on
makes it easier to manage passwords and increases security capabilities.
Authorization is the process of establishing what level of access a legitimate user or service should have.
During sign-in, Conditional Access collects signals from the user, makes decisions based on those signals, and then enforces that decision by
allowing or denying the access request or challenging for a multifactor authentication response.

What is guaranteed in an Azure Service Level Agreement (SLA) for virtual machines?
A. uptime
B. feature availability
C. bandwidth
D. performance
Correct Answer: A
The SLA for virtual machines guarantees 'uptime'. The amount of uptime guaranteed depends on factors such as whether the VMs are in an
availability set or availability zone if there is more than one VM, the distribution of the VMs if there is more than one or the disk type if it is a
single VM.
The SLA for Virtual Machines states:
✑ For all Virtual Machines that have two or more instances deployed across two or more Availability Zones in the same Azure region, we
guarantee you will have
Virtual Machine Connectivity to at least one instance at least 99.99% of the time.
✑ For all Virtual Machines that have two or more instances deployed in the same Availability Set or in the same Dedicated Host Group, we
guarantee you will have Virtual Machine Connectivity to at least one instance at least 99.95% of the time.
✑ For any Single Instance Virtual Machine using Premium SSD or Ultra Disk for all Operating System Disks and Data Disks, we guarantee you
will have Virtual
Machine Connectivity of at least 99.9%.

Your company has 10 departments.
The company plans to implement an Azure environment.
You need to ensure that each department can use a different payment option for the Azure services it consumes.
What should you create for each department?
A. a reservation
B. a subscription
C. a resource group
D. a container instance
Correct Answer: B
There are different payment options in Azure including pay-as-you-go (PAYG), Enterprise Agreement (EA), and Microsoft Customer Agreement
(MCA) accounts.
Your Azure costs are 'per subscription'. You are charged monthly for all resources in a subscription. Therefore, to use different payment options
per department, you will need to create a separate subscription per department. You can create multiple subscriptions in a single Azure Active
Directory tenant.
Incorrect Answers:
A: A reservation is where you commit to a resource (for example a virtual machine) for one or three years. This gives you a discounted price on
the resource for the reservation period. Reservations do not provide a way to use different payment options per department.
C: A resource group is a logical container for Azure resources. You can view the total cost of all the resources in a resource group. However,
resource groups do not provide a way to use different payment options per department.
D: A container instance is an Azure resource used to run an application. Container instances do not provide a way to use different payment

Composite SLAs involve multiple services supporting an application, each with differing levels of availability. For example, consider an App
Service web app that writes to Azure SQL Database. At the time of this writing, these Azure services have the following SLAs:
App Service web apps = 99.95%
✑ SQL Database = 99.99%
What is the maximum downtime you would expect for this application? If either service fails, the whole application fails. The probability of each
service failing is independent, so the composite SLA for this application is 99.95% —ֳ 99.99% = 99.94%. That's lower than the individual SLAs,
which isn't surprising because an application that relies on multiple services has more potential failure points.

You have 1,000 virtual machines hosted on the Hyper-V hosts in a data center.

You need to identify which expenditure model to use for the planned Azure solution.
Which expenditure model should you identify?
A. scalable
B. operational
C. elastic
D. capital
Correct Answer: B
One of the major changes that you will face when you move from on-premises cloud to the public cloud is the switch from capital expenditure
(buying hardware) to operating expenditure (paying for service as you use it). This switch also requires more careful management of your costs.
The benefit of the cloud is that you can fundamentally and positively affect the cost of a service you use by merely shutting down or resizing it
when it's not needed.

No, it is OpEx (Operational Expenditures).
OpEx: The business can achieve ROI immediately in many cases because the infrastructure is managed by the cloud provider.
CapEx: ROI is not usually realized until a long time after the purchase was made because the infrastructure needs to be set up and employees
need to be trained.
Computers, servers, and other hardware needed for on-premises data centers are all examples of CapEx.
Box 3: Yes -
Operational Expenditures (OpEx) are the ongoing costs related to day-to-day operations. A subscription fee for cloud services is considered
OpEx ג€"the cloud provider is making the infrastructure investment upfront, and you only pay for the resources you need as you need them.

Question #357 Topic 1
Your company has 10 offices. You plan to generate several billing reports from the Azure portal. Each report will contain the Azure resource
utilization of each office.
Which Azure Resource Manager feature should you use before you generate the reports?
A. tags
B. templates
C. locks
D. policies
Correct Answer: A
You can use resource tags to 'label' Azure resources. Tags are metadata elements attached to resources. Tags consist of pairs of key/value
strings. In this question, we would tag each resource with a tag to identify each office. For example: Location = Office1. When all Azure
resources are tagged, you can generate reports to list all resources based on the value of the tag. For example: All resources used by Office1.

For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
Hot Area:
Correct Answer:
Box 1: No -
You need to be an administrator of the billing account that has the subscription to be able to transfer the subscription. This could be a Billing
Administrator or
Global Administrator. A subscription owner can manage all resources and permissions within the subscription but cannot transfer ownership of
the subscription.
Box 2: Yes -
You can convert a free trial subscription to Pay-As-You-Go. This is common practice for people who wish to continue using the Azure services
when the free trial period expires.
Box 3: Yes -
You can remove the spending limit, but you can't increase or decrease it.
The spending limit in Azure prevents spending over your credit amount. All new customers who sign up for an Azure free account or
subscription types that include credits over multiple months have the spending limit turned on by default. The spending limit is equal to the
amount of credit and it can't be changed. For example, if you signed up for Azure free account, your spending limit is $200 and you can't change
it to $500. However, you can remove the spending limit. So, you either have no limit, or you have a limit equal to the amount of credit.

Question #361 Topic 1
HOTSPOT -
For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
Hot Area:
Correct Answer:
Box 1: Yes -
A reservation is where you commit to pay for a resource (for example a virtual machine) for one or three years. This gives you a discounted
price on the resource for the reservation period.
Box 2: No -
There are other factors that influence the cost of a virtual machine such as the virtual hard disks attached to the virtual machine. You could
have multiple virtual machines with the same 'size' (B2S in this case) but with different virtual hard disk configurations.
Box 3: Yes -
When a virtual machine is stopped (deallocated), the virtual machine is unloaded/dismounted from the physical server in Azure. In this state,
you are not charged for the virtual machine itself. However, you are still charged for the storage costs of the virtual hard disks attached to the
virtual machine.
If the virtual machine is stopped but not deallocated (this happens if you shut down the virtual machine from the operating system of the virtual
machine), the virtual machine is still mounted on the physical server in Azure and you are charged for the virtual machine itself as well as the
storage costs. To ensure that a virtual machine is 'stopped (deallocated)', you need to stop the virtual machine in the Azure portal.
